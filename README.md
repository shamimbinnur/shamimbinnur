### Hola, It's Shamim Bin Nur ! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful, responsive user interfaces. While I have knowledge of backend development, Currently focusing on front-end development and aspiring to master it.

I'm a firm believer in the importance of writing clean, well-organized code. I strive to stay up-to-date with the latest best practices and techniques to ensure that my code is both efficient and maintainable.

In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new frameworks and libraries, as well as contributing to open source projects. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me reading wathcing documentries and reading both fictional and nonfictional books.
